# SnapQuest – Challenge Game App

SnapQuest is a simple challenge game that we built for our final project in CS 2450 (Software Engineering). The app lets users complete small challenges and earn XP. It’s mainly designed as a fun game to play with friends, where each person can try to finish challenges and track their progress.

## Project Overview
The idea behind SnapQuest is to have a quick and easy challenge system. We added a few example challenges with a description, a difficulty level, and an XP reward. When a user finishes a challenge, they can mark it as completed and gain XP. The XP is saved locally on the device.

This version is an MVP. We focused solely on basic features to keep the application simple and achievable within the project timeline.

## Main Features
- Home screen with the user's XP
- List of sample challenges
- Challenge detail screen
- Button to complete a challenge
- XP increases when a challenge is completed
- XP is saved locally with Hive
- A progress screen showing completed challenges

There is no login system, camera feature, or online system.

The main goal of the project was to build something organized, simple, and working, while applying what we learned in the class.

## Conclusion
Working on SnapQuest helped us practice planning a small project, organizing the code, writing documentation, and building a simple mobile app with Flutter. The MVP works and meets the expectations of the course, and it also gives us something we can continue to improve later.
